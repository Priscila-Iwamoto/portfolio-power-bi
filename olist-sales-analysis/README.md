## 🔍 About the dashboard

The database for this analysis has 8 cvs files and while doing the ETL and modeling process I've felt the need to create one more (d\_calendar). So it was used starschema for this model with 5 dimensions tables and 4 facts. 

About DAX measures, I've created 8 different measures in order to have the analysis I needed, like for example, "AVG Days to Deliver", "Payments Same Period Last Year", "AVG Ticket" and others. I didn't need to create any calculated column, wich was great; I only use calculeted columns if they are indispensables because it contributes to good and fast dashboard performance.

I particularly like to do sales analysis, is a confortable place for me and I it's always satisfying! I think that is very usefull to see the numbers by category, region and sales evolution through time so the company can have strategic decisions in order to increase profit and improve performance.
